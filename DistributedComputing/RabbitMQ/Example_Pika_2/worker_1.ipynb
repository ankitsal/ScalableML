We'll also lose all the messages that were dispatched to this particular worker but were not yet handled.\n",

That way you can be sure that no message is lost, even if the workers occasionally die.\n",

Although it tells RabbitMQ to save the message to disk, there is still a short time window when RabbitMQ has accepted a message and hasn't saved it yet. Also, RabbitMQ doesn't do fsync(2) for every message -- it may be just saved to cache and not really written to the disk. The persistence guarantees aren't strong, but it's more than enough for our simple task queue. If you need a stronger guarantee then you can use publisher confirms."
